// RateLimiter is a per-client token bucket, applied per named route group.
//
// Why this exists: several endpoints here tell an anonymous caller whether an
// account exists — /login answers differently for a known and an unknown
// email — and several more write a database row for every anonymous POST
// (contact, quote, newsletter, public reviews). Unlimited, the first is a
// credential-stuffing oracle and the second is free storage for anyone with
// a loop. Neither needs a sophisticated defence; both need *a* defence.
//
// SCOPE: the counters live in this process. One instance, one set of limits —
// which is what this service runs as today. Behind more than one replica the
// effective limit multiplies by the replica count, and that is the moment to
// move the buckets into Redis (REDIS_ADDR is already configured, just unused).
// Being per-instance is a weaker limit, not a broken one; it is recorded here
// so the weakening is a decision rather than a surprise.
