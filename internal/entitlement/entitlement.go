// Package entitlement answers one question: what is this tenant currently
// allowed to run?
//
// It is deliberately a seam. Today the only implementation reads the tenant's
// subscription out of this service's own database, in-process. When the
// products split into one deployment each — travel, carwash, whatever follows
// — the manage-tenant service becomes the source of truth and the
// implementation is replaced by an HTTP client with a cache. Nothing that
// *calls* this package changes when that happens, which is the entire reason
// the package exists before it is strictly needed. Getting the boundary right
// is cheap now and expensive once thirty call sites have grown their own
// assumptions.
//
// Three rules hold the design together.
//
//  1. Entitlement is not authentication. Auth answers "who are you";
//     entitlement answers "what may this tenant run right now". Mixing them
//     is how you end up re-checking a password to discover whether someone
//     paid.
//
//  2. The platform stores the number, the product decides what it means.
//     Limits are an opaque map here. This package does not know that
//     "locations" is a car wash branch, and the manage-tenant service must
//     not know either — otherwise every new product feature needs a
//     coordinated change in two repositories and a synchronised deploy.
//
//  3. A missing answer is not a denial. See Provider.
//
// This package imports nothing from the rest of the service on purpose. It
// must stay describable over the wire, because one day it will be.
