// Package apierr is the closed set of errors this API is allowed to return.
//
// Every error a client sees is built by one of the constructors below, so the
// wire format cannot drift between endpoints and a client can branch on
// Code — a stable machine-readable identifier — rather than on Message, which
// is prose and may be reworded or translated at any time.
//
// Three things travel with every error:
//
//   - Domain, the subsystem it came from (AUTH, TENANT, DB, UPLOAD, ...).
//     Useful for alerting: "every 5xx today is DOMAIN=UPLOAD" is a far more
//     actionable page than "the API is throwing 500s".
//   - Code, what went wrong, from the fixed list below.
//   - Err, the underlying cause. It is logged, never serialised — the cause
//     of a database failure is for us, not for the caller.
//
// Stack is captured at construction and rendered only in development (see
// response.Err), so a production client never learns our package layout.
